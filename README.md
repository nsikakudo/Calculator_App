<h1> Calculator App</h1>

The Calculator app is a simple calculator app in which users can use in carrying out calculations. 

## App Architectural Features

In this project, I applied some application architectural principles in order to create a roadmap and best practicies to in follow so as to create a well structured and interactive application. I also used Jetpack Compose for this project.

*  I developed data models to store the information that would be shown on the user interface(UI).
*  I also created a domain package, which houses the app's data models.
*  I went further to create a data package, which contains the data that would be displayed on the UI and is the only source from which the data would come.
* I also constructed the UI package, which houses all UI components and screens.
<p>The project was designed in a way to make it easier to introduce new features in the event that they are added.</p>

##  App Libraries

The project leverages the following components and libraries :
*  Jetpack Compose - used to create a well structured UI.
*  Flow Layout - used to layout ui items on the screen.
*  ViewModel - UI related data holder, lifecycle aware.
